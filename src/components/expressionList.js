      icon: "üåä",
      category: "Animation",
      code: "wiggle(frequency, amplitude)",
      explanation: "The wiggle expression creates random movement by applying noise to a property. The frequency parameter controls how fast the wiggling occurs (times per second), while amplitude controls the maximum distance of the wiggle.",
      example: "wiggle(2, 50) // Wiggles 2 times per second with 50 pixel amplitude",
      useCase: "Perfect for creating handheld camera effects, organic text animations, or adding life to static elements."

      explanation: "This expression simulates realistic bouncing physics with gradual decay. It calculates the bounce based on the initial velocity and applies exponential decay over time.",
      example: "Apply to position property after setting keyframes",
      useCase: "Great for bouncing balls, spring animations, elastic UI elements, or any object that should react with realistic physics."

      explanation: "Loop expressions allow you to repeat animation cycles seamlessly. The 'cycle' type creates a continuous loop, while the second parameter defines how many keyframes to exclude from the loop.",
      example: "loopOut('pingpong') // Creates back-and-forth motion",
      useCase: "Essential for creating seamless background animations, rotating elements, or any repetitive motion that needs to loop smoothly."

      explanation: "Creates a pulsing scale effect using sine waves. The amplitude controls how much the scale changes, while frequency determines the speed of the pulse.",
      example: "Adjust 'amp' for pulse intensity and 'freq' for pulse speed",
      useCase: "Perfect for heartbeat animations, breathing effects, music visualizations, or drawing attention to important elements."

      code: "delay = 5; // frames\nd = delay * thisComp.frameDuration * (index - 1);\nthisComp.layer(1).transform.position.valueAtTime(time - d)",
      explanation: "This expression creates a smooth following effect where layers follow each other with a time delay. Each layer follows the previous one, creating a chain-like motion.",
      example: "Apply to multiple layers with different index values",
      useCase: "Ideal for creating snake-like animations, trailing effects, text reveals, or any sequence where elements should follow each other smoothly."

      explanation: "Generates random colors based on the layer index. The seedRandom function ensures consistent colors across renders while still providing variation between layers.",
